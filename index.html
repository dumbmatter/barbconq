      <h1>Barbarian Conquest - Instructions</h1>
      <p>You have six types of units</p>
      <p>(show pictures on green bg and strength/movement stats, bonuses)</p>
      <p>Each turn, every one of your units can move (scouts and chariots get two moves, as long as the first one isn't onto a hill or forest). Move the active unit by right clicking with your mouse or by using the numpad on your keyboard.</p>
      <p>To fight a barbarian unit, move onto its tile (or wait for it to move onto yours). Each unit has a different base strength, and there are also bonuses depending on the types of units (e.g. spearmen are effective against chariots, archers are good at defending hills, etc.) and the terrain (hills and forests provide defensive bonuses).</p>
      <p>You can stack your units in the same tile. This provides better defense, since when a stack is attacked, the best defender against the attacking unit is chosen for battle. But if you keep your units together all the time, you won't be able to explore the island and find the barbarian capital quickly. And the barbarians are constantly training new units to fight you, especially in areas out of sight of your troops. So the longer it takes you to find the capital, the better defenses it will have.</p>
