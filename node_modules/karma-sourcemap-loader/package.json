In these cases source maps\r\ndon't get loaded by karma and you lose the advantages of having them.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nRight now source maps are located via this rule: the preprocessors appends\r\n\".map\" to the file name, and if that file exists it loads and includes it.\r\n\r\nSo if for example you have Hello.js, the preprocessor will try to load source map from\r\nHello.js.map.\r\n\r\nThis is very simple but should work in the majority of cases for standard usage (e.g. with typescript).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nJust write `karma-sourcemap-loader` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"karma-sourcemap-loader\": \"~0.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr just issue the following command:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install karma-sourcemap-loader --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe code below shows a sample configuration of the preprocessor.\r\n```js\r\n// karma.conf.js\r\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\r\n  config.set({\r\n    preprocessors: {\r\n      '**/*.js': ['sourcemap']\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n",
