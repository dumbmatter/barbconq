# New

get rid of global variables, will make testing individual components easier

separate non-ui and ui code better

better plan for testing
  should be able to unit test individual module, without having to load app.ts and index.html

render loop

# Major current tasks

g + left click on tile with unit on it

  what does civ4 do?

minify assets
  include external js files (howler, easystarjs) in minified app.js?

# Minor current tasks

if unit does nothing (just skips turn in city, or out of city), should be no delay. treat it as if it's not visible
  Unit.movementDelay() is used for two setTimeouts: one in Game loop and one in Unit.skipTurn()
    Game: used to pause after activating unit
    skipTurn: used to pause after unit is moved
  how to get rid of these? would need to pre-compute move type. is that possible? should be since it's console.logged anyway.
    return value: some "move type" identifier and a callback function to actually implement the move.

it's possible for AI unit to attack twice in same turn
  async issues? either handle explicitly with callbacks, or set some "attacked" marker earlier
    but if i start chariot next to 2 scouts, it works fine!

start game with 3 units. group first 2 and fortify. skip turn for 3rd one. it will not get activated in subsequent turns, seems auto-skipped for some reason

click+drag for panning on main map
  similar to minimap or right click

barb promotions

end of game
  show stats
    won or lost
    turns
    time spent
    barbs killed, by unit type
    your units, with promotions and killed/not killed
    combine to a score, compare user against a famous conqueror (like civ4 does with leaders)
  have another game.result, "wonThenLost" for when all your units die after you've captured the city previously, and then show stats again

Map.pathFinding should take into account that tile movement cost does not just depend on the tile itself, but also on which tile the unit is moving from
  roads are the obvious implication, but also bonuses for double movement on certain tiles and mobility

keyboard shortcuts
  enter: if not end of turn, cycle through units
    should allow you to let unit continue on path

right click to move
  right click on map -> drag off map -> drag back onto edge tile... path doesn't show up until drag onto another tile!

UI POLISH
  don't need shadow on text in About/Instructions boxes, just makes things blurry
  center minimap on its canvas when it is not the correct aspect ratio
  mapUI.goToCoords should be smooth?
    draw a line between current coords and future coords. if it's long enough, discretize it and use setTimeout to move to each point along the way. uneven discretization can make it decelerate smoothly at the end
  Map.pathFinding will cancel if an enemy blocks the path (OR WILL IT???)... but not when the enemy blocks the last tile! in that case, it'll auto-attack
    should there be any auto-attack? even for unit right outside city the turn before, should it just generally wake up unit that is near enemy?
  when moving through units in Game.moveUnits, should always go through all the units on the current tile before moving on to other units
  When moving to a new tile, fog of war should dissipate immediately, not after delay
  currently, all click events pass through transparency. in civ4, it's only dragging when right click is held. allowing normal left and right clicks can lead to a lot of mis-clicks.
  limit number of entries that can be shown in hover-box?
  CTRL and ALT messages in hover box should only be shown when applicable (>1 unit or >1 unit of a type)
  sound volume - battle-won too loud?
  in battle, have units "hit" (animate move into other unit's tile, then come back) for each round won
    make some function that wraps mapUI.render and calls it repeatedly with an offset for the combat?
  animate unit movement
  what if all orders are given, and then you go back and wake a fortified unit? should do the stuff in chromeUI.onAIMovingDone (switch from red to green button, remove "enter to end turn" text)
    should be done...
      whenever unit is woken up
      whenever group is split and units become active

unit tests
  grouped unit actions
  barb AI?
  visibility

# Barbarian Conquest (barbconq)

monetization ideas
  Make desktop and cordova versions
  GCS
  adsense panel on the side of the screen. put intro/manual content in HTML as divs to hide/show in game, for both SEO and adsense

# Nice to have

fog of war
  range should change depending on hills/forests/peaks in view or slightly out of view

Units.countMovementToCoords is getting really messy and has too much UI stuff there. need a better general concept of delays/movement/UI updating

pathfinding
  point towards water off screen, and it'll actually go there! need to cancel routes when it becomes clear target is not reachable
  doesn't correctly handle multi-unit tiles, since pathfinding algorithm doesn't know about the discreteness of turns (if you have 0.5 moves left, doesn't matter if you move onto grassland or hills)

should I make Units.Group.units and Tile.units lists of objects with ID keys, like game.units and game.groups?

Data
  keep it all in memory. write to indexeddb every turn

TypeScript
  Reevaluate all uses of "any"
  tsc --noImplicitAny

# Future

are unit.initiatePath calls in AI robust? what happens if no path is found, could it lead to infinite loop if unit never moves?

scroll wheel zoom by increasing TILE_SIZE
  but this won't scale the contents of the tiles... so instead have some variable MapUI.scale which scales everything

# Far future

Friendly civs
  big problem: units of multiple civs can be on same tile.

Combat

  collateral damage
  some units are immune to first strikes

  Does cityDefense bonus apply for other civ's cities? Like a neutral city, or an ally's city?

Allow lots of moddability, game modes
  look at what's in civ4

http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/04/01/new-canvas-features/

unit promotions
  add missing promotions from http://www.civfanatics.com/civ4/info/promotions/
  add collateral damage stuff to drills
  combat4/5, woodsman3 healing
  change woodsman descs to "Jungle/Forest"
  Units.promotions should also contain the text used in ChromeUI.bonusText
