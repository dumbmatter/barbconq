abstract controller to handle user input
  panning (done, but is it in the right place?)
  unit-specific movements, somehow defined in the Unit class? would only apply to the active unit, so maybe somehow keep track of the active unit's path and then route these there
    press "c" to go to active unit (if one exists)
    press space to skip to mark active unit as moved and go to next active unit
    active unit movement

typescript live compile

Create a basic unit, handle its basic actions

core modules
  some kind of controller to route keyboard input?
  Combat(attacker : Unit, defender : Unit)

Base object types:
  map (only one of these, containing tile properties at each coordinate)
  unit (each civ can have many of these, and there are many different types)
  city (each civ can have many of these)

Data
  keep it all in memory. write to indexeddb every turn

TypeScript
  Reevaluate all uses of "any"

# Far future notes

Import civ4 maps

2d UI in HTML5
  read about how to do this, in general
  take inspiration from civ5 "strategic view"
  how to make it wrap at sides?

    PROBABLY BEST:
      either threejs or raw webgl. try threejs first, looks easier
