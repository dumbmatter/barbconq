bottom chrome

minimap
  drag to pan around

Controller
  more unit shortcuts
    press space to skip to mark active unit as moved and go to next active unit
    fortify, etc

right click to move

mapUI.goToCoords should be smooth

stacked unit actions and UI

should unitStubs just be replaced by unit objects? It'll be a reference to them, right?

typescript live compile

Create a basic unit, handle its basic actions

combat
  Combat(attacker : Unit, defender : Unit) to handle just the battle itself
  also need to handle things like...
    get list of enemies on tile being moved to
    pick enemy with highest defense

Make randomly generated map into a pangaea facsimile
  how do civ4 maps do it?

fog of war, field of view

PLAN TO GET INITIAL PUBLICITY: BarbarianBattle.com
  SEE EMAIL FOR BETTER IDEA
  "Barbarian Battle - web-based port of Civ4's combat system"
  make a mode with just your units and barbarian units and battle
  scouts, warriors, archers, chariots, axemen, spearmen
  roads (randomly generate a few)
  forts
  "From the makers of Basketball GM, a free single-player basketball simulation game"
  Help section: explain units, movement, combat
  Make desktop and cordova versions, put ads in it

---

Base object types:
  map (only one of these, containing tile properties at each coordinate)
  unit (each civ can have many of these, and there are many different types)
  city (each civ can have many of these)

Data
  keep it all in memory. write to indexeddb every turn

TypeScript
  Reevaluate all uses of "any"

# Far future notes

Import civ4 maps

2d UI in HTML5
  read about how to do this, in general
  take inspiration from civ5 "strategic view"
  how to make it wrap at sides?
  libraries
    threejs?

    PROBABLY BEST:
      either threejs or raw webgl. try threejs first, looks easier

Allow lots of moddability, game modes
  look at what's in civ4
