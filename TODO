    PROBABLY BEST:
      either threejs or raw webgl. try threejs first, looks easier

For some reason, I feel the desire to try making a TypeScript-based Civilization-type game. My main problem is I have no idea how to do the UI. The core of it is a large grid map with the following properties:

* Can contain units or other things on top of the tiles
* Can easily zoom in/out
* Can easily pan around
* Wraps around the sides as you pan

I guess it should use the <canvas> element. But is there any library on top of that which will make my life easier? Some Googling didn't seem to turn up anything promising. I don't really care about it being a beautiful or perfect UI since I mainly want to hack on the backend of the game at first, but I'd really like to have at least some semi-reasonable UI.


Base object types:
  map (only one of these, containing tile properties at each coordinate)
  unit (each civ can have many of these, and there are many different types)
  city (each civ can have many of these)

Data
  keep it all in memory. write to indexeddb every turn
