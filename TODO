remove getTile?

weird stuff happens when two of the user's units are on the same tile - disappearing from map temporarily, missing highlight, etc.
  move both on same tile. skip turn for first, move second to another tile, original tile looks blank. move back on, and it looks like there is only one unit there, and the first unit doesn't show up as activated on the map at the beginning of next turn

Controller
  more unit shortcuts
    see if unit has action in this.actions. If so, do it
    fortify
    sentry
  enter to end turn, rather than automatically calling newTurn

fortify
  defensive bonus
  healing

sentry

fog of war
  every tile starts with fog=true
  set fog=false on unit creation and unit movement

field of view
  before displaying anything
    set each tile to visible=false
    loop through all the user's units and set visible=true when appropriate

right click to move

mapUI.goToCoords should be smooth

stacked unit actions and UI

typescript live compile

Create a basic unit, handle its basic actions

combat
  Combat(attacker : Unit, defender : Unit) to handle just the battle itself
  also need to handle things like...
    get list of enemies on tile being moved to
    pick enemy with highest defense

Make randomly generated map into a pangaea facsimile
  how do civ4 maps do it?

fog of war, field of view

PLAN TO GET INITIAL PUBLICITY: BarbarianBattle.com
  SEE EMAIL FOR BETTER IDEA
  "Barbarian Battle - web-based port of Civ4's combat system"
  make a mode with just your units and barbarian units and battle
  scouts, warriors, archers, chariots, axemen, spearmen
  roads (randomly generate a few)
  forts
  "From the makers of Basketball GM, a free single-player basketball simulation game"
  Help section: explain units, movement, combat
  Make desktop and cordova versions, put ads in it

UI POLISH
  center minimap on its canvas when it is not the correct aspect ratio


---

Base object types:
  map (only one of these, containing tile properties at each coordinate)
  unit (each civ can have many of these, and there are many different types)
  city (each civ can have many of these)

Data
  keep it all in memory. write to indexeddb every turn

TypeScript
  Reevaluate all uses of "any"

# Far future notes

Import civ4 maps

2d UI in HTML5
  read about how to do this, in general
  take inspiration from civ5 "strategic view"
  how to make it wrap at sides?
  libraries
    threejs?

    PROBABLY BEST:
      either threejs or raw webgl. try threejs first, looks easier

Allow lots of moddability, game modes
  look at what's in civ4
